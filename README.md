# hello-world
My first repo!
==============



Hello friendly visitor of cyberspace!

I've used git source control in visual studio previously, but never partaken in this community of code writers. This Hello World repo will represent my first impression on the code sharing heaven known as github.

I'm primarily a .NET and windows developer, but as with Microsoft, I've started to adjust my focus to a more open take on environments, languages and tooling, hence my interest in github. I work as an IT-Consultant and I love helping clients with their needs and problems. Writing software is great fun, and doing it to help someone is ever better!

Let's get started with this Hello World project, and add some code!
